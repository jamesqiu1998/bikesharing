-Areas with a darker shade of blue represents the heavy traffic in start location. This allows us to better analyze where to place more bikes within the city.

- This graph shows the year of birth for all Citibike users. We can visualize that as user's age grows, the average trip duration increases.  

## Summary
- To summerize, we should shift our focus on the areas where start location are the most popular, so to attract more users into our transport system. 
- By shifting our attention over to female users, we should promote campigns that attracts female users as we are aware that we do not have a lot of female users. By doing this, not only we can better serve the community, but also to balance our client group.
